# SQL Analysis for RSVP Movies
## Project Description
RSVP Movies, a prominent Indian film production company, is venturing into the global market with a new movie release planned for 2022. To ensure a successful launch, they seek to leverage data-driven insights from past movie performances. This project involves analyzing a dataset of movies released over the past three years using SQL to provide actionable recommendations for their upcoming project.

The analysis is divided into four segments, each focusing on deriving significant insights from various table combinations within the IMDB dataset. As a data analyst and SQL expert, you will:

### Examine the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and table details to understand relationships and attributes.
### Inspect and understand each table within the dataset to identify key features.
### Perform SQL-based analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

The goal is to provide RSVP Movies with comprehensive data-driven recommendations to optimize their global release strategy and enhance the movie's chances of success in the international market.
